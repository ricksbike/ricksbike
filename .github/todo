These are the step by steps to pull data from strava to GitHub

Strava API Application:

Application Name: Choose a name for your application.
Category: Select the appropriate category for your application.
Website: Provide the URL of your application's website.
Authorization Callback Domain: Enter the domain where users will be redirected after they authorize your application. This is crucial for OAuth authentication.
Client ID and Client Secret: These will be generated by Strava once you create your application. You'll need these credentials to authenticate your API requests.
GitHub Repository:

Repository Name: Create a new repository on GitHub where you want to store your Strava activities.
GitHub Actions Workflow: Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the process of fetching Strava activities and pushing them to your repository. This involves creating a workflow file (e.g., .github/workflows/upload_strava.yml) with the necessary steps to run your script and commit the changes.
Script to Fetch Strava Activities:

API Requests: Use the Strava API to fetch your activities. You'll need to make authenticated requests using your Client ID and Client Secret.
Data Storage: Save the fetched activities in a format of your choice (e.g., JSON, CSV) and store them in your GitHub repository.
